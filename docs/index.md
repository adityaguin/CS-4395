## Welcome to Aditya Guin's HLT page!

My name is Aditya Guin, and I'm currently a senior @ UTD. Contained in this repository are various projects completed in CS 4395 (Human Language Technologies). 
Though officially HLT, this course is primarily an NLP course, a rapidly growing field within AI. Python is primarily used in these projects, and many libraries such as NLTK is incorporated as well.
