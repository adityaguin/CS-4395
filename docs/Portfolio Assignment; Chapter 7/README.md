# Description

Wordnet is explored in this google collab notebook. We explore synsets, wordnet hierarchies, and also
explore sentiwordnet. Metrics including Wu-Palmer similarity and Lesk's algorithm are also used to understand
how NLTK imposes similarity between words. Finally mutual information is calculated using probabilities in an 
collocation exploring drill.
