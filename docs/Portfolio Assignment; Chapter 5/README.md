# Overview

## Desciption
Anatomy textbook chapter 1 text is taken in this project. Words are tokenized, lexical diversity is calculated, 
and part of speech tagging is done to identify frequencies of nouns. These nouns are used as the word bank in the guessing 
game.


Interactive guessing game that user can play. Word is chosen, and user guesses letters that are filled in if they're correct.
There is a point system, and everytime a user guesses the correct letter, one point is added. Each incorrect guess
reduces a point. Error checking is placed to not guess the same letter twice, and additional checks are done as well. 


## Tools used
Python, nltk's stopwords, lemmatizer, word_tokenize, and pos_tagging
