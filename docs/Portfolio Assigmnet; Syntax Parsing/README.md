# Portfolio Assignment: Syntax Parsing
In this assignment, a sentence is parsed in three different ways: PSG tree, Dependency Parsing, and SRL Parsing. Each parser is different and returns unique information. PSG Tree breaks down sentences into a hierarchy of phrases.
Dependency parser identifies verb phrases, objects, and clauses. SRL parser helps understand the semantics for a sentence.

Allen NLP and Stanford's Dependencies list was used to help with the parsing.
